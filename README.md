# HubSpot Contact Deduplication

This project implements an Express.js app that handles HubSpot contact deduplication via a webhook. It listens for phone number updates, searches for duplicate contacts in HubSpot, and merges the duplicate contacts, keeping the oldest one as the primary contact.

## Features

- **Phone number normalization**: Normalizes incoming phone numbers to ensure consistent formatting.
- **Search for duplicates**: Searches for contacts in HubSpot using multiple phone fields (`phone`, `hs_whatsapp_phone_number`, `mobilephone`, `secondary_phone_number`).
- **Merging duplicates**: If duplicate contacts are found, they are merged into the oldest (primary) contact based on the `createdate` field.
- **Logging**: Logs all operations (success and failure) with timestamps to a log file for easy tracking and debugging.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, you need to have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm**: Node.js comes with npm (Node Package Manager) installed.
- **HubSpot API Key**: You will need a HubSpot API key. Follow [HubSpot's OAuth documentation](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/methods/auth/oauth-overview) for OAuth setup.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/hubspot-deduplication.git
   cd hubspot-deduplication
   ```
   Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy
npm install
Create a .env file in the root of the project with the following variables:

env
Copy
HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_hubspot_access_token
Replace your_hubspot_access_token with your actual HubSpot API access token.

Usage
Start the server:

bash
Copy
npm start
The server will run on http://localhost:3000 by default.

Trigger the Webhook:
The server listens for incoming POST requests on the /webhook/deduplicate endpoint. You can trigger the webhook by sending a request with the propertyValue (phone number) as part of the request body.

Example request:

json
Copy
{
"propertyValue": "8801889983314"
}
Successful Response:
If duplicate contacts are found and merged, the server will return a response with a message confirming the successful merge:

json
Copy
{
"message": "Contacts Merged Successfully",
"newID": "primary_contact_id"
}
No Duplicates:
If no duplicates are found, the response will be:

json
Copy
{
"message": "No duplicate found"
}
Error Response:
If there's an error fetching or merging the contacts, a 500 status code with the error details will be returned:

json
Copy
{
"error": "Failed to fetch or merge contacts",
"details": "Error message"
}
Logging
The app uses winston for logging. Logs are written to the console and to a file logs/app.log. Each log entry includes a timestamp and a log level (info for successes, error for failures).

Logs can be found in the logs/ directory.

Development
To run the app in development mode, you can use nodemon for automatic server restarts:

Install nodemon globally:

bash
Copy
npm install -g nodemon
Start the server using nodemon:

bash
Copy
nodemon server.js
